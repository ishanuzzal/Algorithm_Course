## Dynamic Programming Problems
1. Get the total amount by using given minimum number of coins(Can use a individual coin several times).(memorization)
2. Given some coins.you need to check is it possible to get the given amount by using those coins(each coin can be used at one time). 1 in output means possible and 0 means impossible.(tabulation/itteration) 
3. Given some coins. You need to findOut how many possible combination can be made to get the given amount by using one coin at a time.(tabulation)
4. Given some coins. You need to check how many possible combination can be made to get the given amount by using those coins(infinite number of coins). (tabulation)
5. Finding length of the longest decreasing subsequence from given array.(tabulaton)
