## Dynamic Programming Problems
1. Get the total amount by using given minimum number of coins(Can use a individual coin several times).(memorization)
2. Given some coins.you need to check is it possible to get the given amount by using those coins(each coin can be used at one time). 1 in output means possible and 0 means impossible.(tabulation/itteration)
